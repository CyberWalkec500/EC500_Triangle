# EC500_TriangleProject


## User Story:
- As a **game player**, I want to combine online games with real life. I not only can play games on the phone, but also can take physical activities outside.
- As a **sponsor**, I want to display my product in game to attract more customers.




## Minimum Valuable Product: 

- **Object Detection**

  - Recognize the objects and classify them by labeling. For example, if we use a camera to scan the wooden chair, and it will return what it is and label it with wood.

- **Profile page**
  - This is a visualization page for users to see what resources and the amount they have collected. Besides, they can use these resources to build their own architecture.

- **AR**
  - When users start their camera and point to the open area, the architecture will display here by AR.

## Tech: 
- Object Detection
- Augmented Reality, Unity
- Swift, C#, Python
- AWS
